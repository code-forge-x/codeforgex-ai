# ðŸ”´ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ REMINDER: THE NEXT STEP IS TO IMPLEMENT ORCHESTRATION & PHASE TRANSITION LOGIC (BACKEND + FRONTEND + PROMPT ENGINEERING) AS THE TOP PRIORITY. DO NOT PROCEED TO OTHER FEATURES UNTIL THIS IS COMPLETE. ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸ”´

- This is required for real end-to-end testing and unlocking the full workflow.
- Update prompt templates in the admin utility as recommended below.
- After implementation, test the full requirements â†’ blueprint â†’ code â†’ testing â†’ deployment flow.

## ðŸŸ¡ In Progress / To Do
- ðŸ”´ **Orchestration & Phase Transition Logic**
  - âœ… Backend: Phase advancement endpoint and session update
  - âœ… Frontend: UI controls for phase transitions (advance, approve, reject, edit)
  - âœ… Frontend: Blueprint approval/edit workflow
  - âœ… Backend: Intent detection for phase advancement (auto-advance via /intent-detect)
  - âœ… LLM: Phase-specific prompt engineering (update prompt templates for each phase)
  - ðŸŸ¡ Testing: End-to-end workflow (requirements â†’ code â†’ testing â†’ deployment)
  - ðŸ”´ **NEW:** Implement explicit phase state tracking in session model (current_phase, phase_history)
  - ðŸ”´ **NEW:** Enrich session context with all user answers and artifacts for progressive prompts
  - ðŸ”´ **NEW:** Progressive prompt engineering: reference previous context, pre-fill known values, only ask for missing info
  - ðŸŸ¡ **NEW:** Frontend: Visually indicate current phase and what's needed to advance
  - ðŸŸ¡ **NEW:** Default to concise, actionable responses; offer "expand for details"
  - ðŸŸ¡ **REMINDER:** Review and update all related documentation after each major change
- ðŸŸ¡ **Document Guide Generation**
  - ðŸŸ¡ Fix internal server error for large/complex prompts (likely due to Claude API limits)
  - ðŸŸ¡ Add chunking or summarization for long code/doc requests
- ðŸŸ¡ **Advanced Error Handling**
  - ðŸŸ¡ More granular error messages for Claude API failures
  - ðŸŸ¡ User-facing error notifications for quota/rate limit issues
- ðŸŸ¡ **Admin & Analytics Dashboard**
  - ðŸŸ¡ Token usage tracking and analytics
  - ðŸŸ¡ User/project management UI
- ðŸŸ¡ **Prompt Management System**
  - ðŸŸ¡ External prompt template storage and versioning
- ðŸŸ¡ **Further EA/Code Features**

## Orchestration & Phase Transition Logic (Tracking)
- **Current Status:**
  - Requirements, blueprint, and code phases are implemented and UI is unified.
  - Phase transitions (advance, approve, reject, edit) are fully functional in both backend and frontend.
  - Blueprint approval/edit workflow is complete and user-friendly.
  - Backend intent detection for phase advancement is complete and auto-advances phases when intent is detected in user messages.
  - LLM phase-specific prompt engineering is complete and enhanced templates are ready for use.
  - **Next:** Begin real-time end-to-end workflow testing and log results here.
- **Next Steps:**
  - ðŸ”´ Implement phase state tracking and context enrichment.
  - ðŸŸ¡ Update frontend to show phase status and requirements.
  - ðŸŸ¡ Test with real user flows and log results.
  - ðŸŸ¡ Review and update documentation after each major change.

## Technical Review & Real-World Testing Feedback
- **Phase Orchestration:**
  - Issue: System not reliably detecting/advancing phases; user experience is confusing.
  - Action: Add explicit phase state tracking and auto-advance logic.
- **Context Management:**
  - Issue: System doesn't build on previous answers; user repeats info.
  - Action: Enrich session context, reference previous answers, pre-fill known values.
- **Content Formatting:**
  - Issue: Inconsistent code formatting, unclear code blocks.
  - Action: Enforce strict code block formatting, use phase-specific templates, validate code before output.
- **Response Style:**
  - Issue: Responses too verbose, not actionable enough.
  - Action: Default to concise, actionable responses; offer details on demand.
- **Action Plan:**
  - Implement all above improvements in backend, prompt engineering, and frontend.
  - Test with real user flows and update documentation after each major change.
