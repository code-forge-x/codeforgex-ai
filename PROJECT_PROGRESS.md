  - Issue: System doesn't build on previous answers; user repeats info.
  - Action: Enrich session context, reference previous answers, pre-fill known values.
- **Content Formatting:**
  - Issue: Inconsistent code formatting, unclear code blocks.
  - Action: Enforce strict code block formatting, use phase-specific templates, validate code before output.
- **Response Style:**
  - Issue: Responses too verbose, not actionable enough.
  - Action: Default to concise, actionable responses; offer details on demand.
- **Action Plan:**
  - Implement all above improvements in backend, prompt engineering, and frontend.
  - Test with real user flows and update documentation after each major change.
